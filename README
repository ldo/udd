udd (“Unix Dungeons and Dragons”) is one of many versions of a very
old game, dating back to minicomputer systems of the 1970s. For more
information about the history of the game, see
<http://www.digital-eel.com/files/dndpage_files/DND.htm>.

This version comes from Chuck Cranor and a whole bunch of other people
(see VERSION for the details). My main contribution has been to add a
whole lot of comments explaining the inner workings of the program.

See INSTALL for build/run instructions.

See also my udd_hack scripts <https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/udd_hack> for
examining and editing the dungeon and character files.
